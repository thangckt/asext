This is typically the first step in a computational study, because many properties are dependent on the atomic positions. The optimization algorithm adjusts the atomic positions in each step based on the forces acting on the atoms, and continues until the forces are below a certain threshold, indicating that the geometry is optimized.\n",

This allows the system to explore a range of geometries and can be used to simulate temperature and pressure effects, study dynamic processes, or sample configurations for further study. In contrast to a geometry optimization, which finds the minimum energy configuration, an MD simulation can explore higher-energy configurations and provides information on the dynamics of the system."
